C++11 wrapper classes for GDAL/OGR.

These are some small wrapper classes for [GDAL](https://gdal.org) offering
* classes with RAII instead of the arcane cleanup functions in stock GDAL
* works with GDAL 1 and 2
* allows you to write less boilerplate code

The classes are not very complete, they just have the code I needed for
various programs.

## Using

Just copy `gdalcpp.hpp` over into your include directory.


## Documentation
